Modular, SSL, XMLRPC Server with Authentication for Python using Twistd
Sami Khan
Etopian Inc. (http://www.etopian.com)

In order to run:  twistd -y xmlrpc_app.py

You may need to edit xmlrpc_app.py in order to point it to the directory in which
the server files reside.

See protocol.py for an example of how to write your own class to extend the server.

See xmlrpc.conf for configuring the server with our own class, port, etc.

See httpspass.conf to define the username password of your server. The password is a hash.

Also you should generate your own certificates andd not use mine, they are for testing only.

If you need any development done, be sure to hire me (http://www.etopian.com/quote)!
