version .1


How to use:
=================================
* Install Twisted
* Install Zope Interfaces
* Install pyOpenSSL
* Install web2 from Twisted: (either from svn or for the Web2 package)
	svn co svn://svn.twistedmatrix.com/svn/Twisted/trunk Twisted
* Move web2 into twisted
* Make salted hash password (salt is the last 2 characters of the password)
	 from crypt import crypt
	 password = 'mypass'
	 crypt(password, password[-2:]) #(use the last two characters as the salt)
* Add username/password to httpspass.conf
* Create a Twisted Client
    from twisted.web.xmlrpc import Proxy
    from twisted.internet import reactor

    def printValue(value):
        print repr(value)
        reactor.stop()

    def printError(error):
        print 'error', error
        reactor.stop()

    proxy = Proxy('https://%s:%s@localhost:9870' % ('myfancyusername', 'ohmygod'))
    proxy.callRemote('echo', 'hello, im echoing this').addCallbacks(printValue, printError)
    reactor.run()
* Start the server:
	twistd -y xmlrpc_app.py
* Test the client:
	python client.py
	
	
Some additional notes:
=================================
You may need to edit xmlrpc_app.py in order to point it to the directory in which
the server files reside.

See protocol.py for an example of how to write your own class to extend the server.

See xmlrpc.conf for configuring the server with our own class, port, etc.

See httpspass.conf to define the username password of your server. The password is a hash.

Generate your own certificates, don't use mine, they are for testing only.

If you need any development done, be sure to hire me (http://www.etopian.com/)!
